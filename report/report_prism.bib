    abstract = {{The problem of node overlap removal is to adjust the layout generated by typical graph drawing methods so that nodes of non-zero width and height do not overlap, yet are as close as possible to their original positions. We give an O(n log n) algorithm for achieving this assuming that the number of nodes overlapping any single node is bounded by some constant. This method has two parts, a constraint generation algorithm which generates a linear number of ”separation” constraints and an algorithm for finding a solution to these constraints ”close” to the original node placement values. We also extend our constraint solving algorithm to give an active set based algorithm which is guaranteed to find the optimal solution but which has considerably worse theoretical complexity. We compare our method with convex quadratic optimization and force scan approaches and find that it is faster than either, gives results of better quality than force scan methods and similar quality to the quadratic optimisation approach.}},

    abstract = {{Techniques for drawing graphs based on force-directed placement and virtual physical models have proven surprisingly successful in producing good layouts of undirected graphs. Aspects of symmetry, structure, clustering and reasonable vertex distribution arise from initial, formless clouds of points. However, when nodes must be labeled and point vertices are replaced by non-point vertices, simple force-directed models produce unreadable drawings, even for a moderate number of nodes. This paper describes the application of two post-processing techniques that can be applied to any initial vertex layout to produce uncluttered layouts with non-point nodes.}},
